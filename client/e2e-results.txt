Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access

  - your web server isn't accessible

     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  > Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5174

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

  11) Documentation Page
       Accessibility
         "before each" hook for "should have proper heading hierarchy":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

http://localhost:5174/docs

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `Accessibility`

       Accessibility
         "before each" hook for "should have proper heading hierarchy":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `Accessibility`

         "before each" hook for "should display floating AI button":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  > Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5174

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `Floating Button`

  14) DocsAI Chatbot
       Responsive Design
         should display correctly on desktop:
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

http://localhost:5174/docs

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  > Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5174

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer
