## üéØ Overview

This document provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for the BotBuilder Platform's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and Multi-Tenant system. The testing suite ensures that:

- ‚úÖ Users can register and authenticate securely
- ‚úÖ Organizations are created and managed properly
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation is enforced
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions are correctly applied
- ‚úÖ Organization members can be managed effectively
- ‚úÖ Bot operations respect organizational boundaries
- ‚úÖ Edge cases and error scenarios are handled gracefully

### Testing Methodology

- **Black Box Testing**: Testing from user perspective without knowledge of internal implementation
- **White Box Testing**: Testing with knowledge of code structure and database schema
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between different system components
- **Security Testing**: Ensuring proper access control and data isolation

---
